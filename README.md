Hello!

Welcome to the source code of MTRI/IRI 's field data collection
for Android devices.

The Git repository is created in the root directory of a project
created in Android Studio 1.0 using OpenJDK 1.7 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Everything should still work with Oracle JDK, or on Macintosh or 
Windows systems, as long as the directory structure stays 
consistent.

To immediately deploy the app as-is on an Android device, copy:

	app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

onto the device and install it. Make sure "Unknown Sources" is
enabled Settings under Security or Developer Options.

Depending on how powerful your computer is, and if you have
access to an Android device, you may opt not to use Android 
Studio. Android Studio is useful for emulation if no Android 
device is available, and alternatively, if an Android device is 
available for testing the app then more lightweight text editors 
can be used instead of Android Studio.
