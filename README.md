Hello!

Welcome to the source code of MTRI/IRI 's field data collection
for Android devices.

The Git repository is created in the root directory of a project
created in Android Studio 1.0 using OpenJDK 1.7 on Ubuntu 14.04.

To open this project in Android Studio, clone the project files,
choose File>Open Project, then navigate to folder that holds this 
file and choose Open.

All project files are included in the repo for the sake of smooth
integration with Android Studio, if you are using other editors 
then from this directory the code that matters is in:

	app/src/main/
